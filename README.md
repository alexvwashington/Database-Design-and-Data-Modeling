# School Intervention Database Introduction

The purpose of this database is to track student behavior. Teachers are able to log any positive or negative behavior incidents that happen with their students. Teachers are able to access all incident reports attached to their students even if they were not the person to log the incident.

This database will help teachers implement purposeful intervention strategies. These intervention strategies may also be logged in the database. This database is used to teacher collaboration in student success.
